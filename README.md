colorme
=======

`colorme` is stupid command to pipe at the end of and output in order to color it.

###Usage

`ls | colorme green`

###Installation

clone this repo and put `colorme` in your `$PATH`. Remember to check that it's executable.

###Why?

I got a thing for colors, and when I started using [shpotify](http://harishnarayanan.org/projects/shpotify/) to check the current song playing in Spotify I couldn't watch the output in white...

###...but there's already something like this!

Really?? I didn't even check... Please open an issue with a link :)

###TODOs

* Using issues for this
* Proper options check
* Usage if no option is passed
* Help
* Semver
* Warning when used not in pipe, see `grep`
